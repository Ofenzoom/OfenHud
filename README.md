OfenHud
------------------------------------------------------
This custom HUD was made for Counter-Strike: Source. I recommend it for any movement-gamemode. Flashbangs and playermodel are highlighted for Trikz.

After the download, extract the .zip and copy all contents of the OfenHud folder into your "custom" folder:
steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Source\cstrike\custom

If you do not have a custom folder yet, you have to create it. 
Now your OfenHud is automatically loaded by launching the game.
